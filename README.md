# Panne-Picks üìö‚ú®  
*An AI-Powered Semantic Book Recommender*

---

## üìö Overview

**Panne-Picks** is an intelligent, emotion-driven book recommendation system.  
It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Vector Search**, to help users find books matching their emotions, preferences, and interests.

This project was developed while completing the freeCodeCamp course,  
**"Build a Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs ‚Äì Full Course."**
