# Panne-Picks üìö‚ú®  
*An AI-Powered Semantic Book Recommender*

---

## üìö Overview

**Panne-Picks** is an intelligent, emotion-driven book recommendation system.  
It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Vector Search**, to help users find books matching their emotions, preferences, and interests.

This project was developed while completing the freeCodeCamp course,  
**"Build a Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs ‚Äì Full Course."**

## üöÄ Features
- Curated **Database of Books** from Kaggle
- **Semantic Search** using vector embeddings
- **Emotion-Based Sentiment Analysis** (7+ emotion categories)
- **LLM-Powered Book Search**
- **Text Data Cleaning** (shortening descriptions, removing noise)
- **Zero-Shot Text Classification** (Fiction vs Non-Fiction)
- **Interactive Gradio Dashboard** for easy exploration
- **LLM fine-tuning and Hugging Face integration**

## üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishantsingh604/panne-picks.git
   cd panne-picks
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in your root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or run the Gradio dashboard:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   python gradio-dashboard.py
   ```

## üßê How it Works

- **Data Cleaning:** Remove unwanted entries and clean book descriptions.
- **Vector Search:** Use semantic search to match user queries with similar book descriptions.
- **Text Classification:** Predict whether a book is Fiction or Non-Fiction without labeled training data.
- **Emotion Analysis:** Assign emotional scores (joy, sadness, fear, suspense, etc.) to each book.
- **User Dashboard:** An interactive UI where users can input moods or search preferences to receive book recommendations.
